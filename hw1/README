			Operating Systems : Homework 1


Code Refered From internet:
	1. The read write code was refered from  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1184274/how-to-read-write-files-within-a-linux-kernel-module/1184346#1184346
	2. getopt code was refered from http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Example-of-Getopt.html#Example-of-Getopt

Working Functionality:
	1. Correctness of the output file
	2. Correctness of the syscall return value
	3. Correctness of the syscall behavior
	4. Error Handling

Things Not working
	1. Not able to pass second argument to syscall due to kernel config issues.

NOTE: Did NOT implement Atomic mode
